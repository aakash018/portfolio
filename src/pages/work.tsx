                <p> This is a web app,  whose main purpose is to keep tract and devide
                 expenditure, for students living  together. The motivation of the project
                  came when me and my my room mates had a really big problem keeping tract of the expences </p>


                  <p> Basically after you make your account, you cna add information about
                       expances and the app automatically divides it to every roommates and
                        keep tracks everyonsâ€™s lone with eachother. </p>
