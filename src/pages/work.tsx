              Dijkstra's algorithm, devised by Dutch computer scientist Edsger
              W. Dijkstra, is a fundamental method for finding the shortest path
              in a weighted graph from a single source node to all other nodes.
              It operates by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest
              known distance from the source and updating the distances to
              neighboring nodes, gradually building the shortest path
              tree.Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees the shortest path when all
              edge weights are non-negative.

              This web app allows users to input start and end points on a grid
              while designating obstacles or walls. The algorithm then
              calculates the shortest path, avoiding the obstacles, and displays
              the route dynamically. This interactive platform serves as a
              hands-on tool for understanding pathfinding algorithms like
              Dijkstra's in a visually engaging manner.

              The subject of dreams has always facinated me. The only bad part
              about them, we often tend to forget it once we wake up.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dreams is a web app that letâ€™s you keep record of these precious
              memories. Keeping track of your dreams lets you know your self
              better. Not only you can keep tour journal, but you can also share
              this with worls, and read other stories and have time of your
              life.
            </p>

            <p>
              The full project was developed by me using React and CSS for
              frontend and Node and Express on backend, Javascript being
              language of choice.
